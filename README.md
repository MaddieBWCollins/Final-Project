# Final-Project
When you open this program, it pops up with a question. The question asks you to pick a number between 3 and 10, or type random. After you respond to this question, it asks you to pick another number between 3 and 10, or type random. After this question, it will ask you to choose a color, or type random. After you have answered all three questions, a turtle window will pop up. In this window, the turtle will begin drawing shapes based off of the numbers you have input. This will continue until you close the screen. This screen could be used as a screensaver, or possibly as a game on a laptop, where you lay the screen flat and everyone puts a token on the screen, and the last person to have a shape drawn under their token loses. You can also interact with this screen by clicking on it, which will make the turtle move to where you clicked.
